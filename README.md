Loan Prediction Project
Overview
This project is focused on building a machine learning model to predict loan approval status based on customer data. The dataset includes various customer attributes like income, education, credit history, and more. By analyzing and preprocessing this data, we develop predictive models to assist in loan decision-making.

Features
The project includes:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers in the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features such as TotalIncome and applying transformations to reduce skewness.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships.
Modeling: Training and evaluating machine learning models (e.g., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes) to predict loan status.
Deployment-Ready Code: Preprocessing steps and predictions added back to the dataset for easy integration.
Dataset
The dataset consists of:

Training Data: Contains labeled data used to train the models.
Test Data: Unlabeled data where predictions are generated.
Key columns:

Gender, Married, Education, Credit_History, ApplicantIncome, LoanAmount, etc.
Target variable: Loan_Status (Yes/No).
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Libraries:
pandas and numpy for data manipulation.
matplotlib for visualizations.
scikit-learn for machine learning models and preprocessing.
Workflow
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables.
Standardize numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize data distributions and relationships using boxplots and histograms.
Understand correlations between features and the target variable.
Model Training:

Train multiple models (e.g., Decision Tree, Naive Bayes).
Evaluate accuracy on test data.
Prediction and Integration:

Generate predictions for new test data.
Add predictions back to the dataset for deployment.
Results
Achieved an accuracy of:
Decision Tree: ~65%
Naive Bayes: ~84%
Predictions are mapped back into Yes/No format for readability.

Future Improvements
Experiment with more advanced models like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Add visualization dashboards for better insights.
